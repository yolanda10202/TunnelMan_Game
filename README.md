# TunnelMan_Game
Tunnel Man is an arcade-like game played on the computer.

## Description
In Tunnel Man, the player (a tunnel man) has to dig around an oil field looking for oil. Whenever the player discovers all the oil available in the oil field, he or she will advance to the next level.

However, there are several protestors around the area who hate the player and wants him or her to leave the oil field. If a protestor finds the player, he will move closer to the player and attack the player. If the player is attacked too many times, the player will lose all his or her health and leave the oil field (game over). On the bright side, there are several ways to prevent that from happening. The player can attack the protestors with his or her watergun (with limited amounts of fires available). The watergun will stun the protestors and, if attack them for a certain amount of times, will irritate them enough to give up protesting. Players can also drop gold pieces (can be found as the player digs around the oil field) on their way to bribe the protestors to leave.
